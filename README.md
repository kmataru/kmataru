## Hi there 👋

I'm Paul, a developer and automation enthusiast turned into passionate DevOps engineer 🧟
My journey started with code, curiosity, and a deep desire to automate the repetitive, mundane tasks of development and operations.

## 👨‍💻 **From Code to Cloud**

I began my career like many others—writing lines of code, building web applications, and managing backend systems. As my experience grew, so did my love for efficiency and automation. Eventually, I realized that the future I envisioned wasn't just about creating software but streamlining how it's deployed, maintained, and scaled.

> _"Nobody dreamed of becoming a DevOps engineer."_

And yet, here I am, embracing the philosophy of continuous improvement and automating everything from infrastructure to delivery pipelines.

## 🚀 **DevOps: My New Frontier**

DevOps isn't just a role for me—it's a mindset. I thrive on making systems more efficient, reliable, and scalable. I transitioned from traditional development to DevOps to combine the best of both worlds: coding and automating.

### **What I'm Passionate About**:
- **Automations**: Terraform and CI/CD pipelines are my playgrounds.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Specializing in Azure to create robust, scalable architectures.
- **DevSecOps**: Infusing security into every stage of development and operations.
- **NoOps**: Exploring how automation can reduce operational overhead for development teams.

## 🛠️ **My DevOps Toolbox**

Here are some of the tools and technologies I use to transform visions into reality:

| **Tool**          | **Area**          |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Terraform         | Infrastructure as Code |
| Docker            | Containerization and Orchestration |
| Azure DevOps      | CI/CD Pipelines and Cloud Automation |
| PowerShell        | Scripting and Automation |
